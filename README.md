## 60-second pitch

Running multiple agents against the same repo creates coordination chaos. Two
instances claim the same task. Edits collide on the same file. A crashed run
holds a lock nobody can see. The usual answer — Claude Squad, ccswarm — bundles
coordination inside a full workspace orchestrator: you buy into their tmux
layout, their lifecycle, their mental model. That's a lot of product for what
is, underneath, a shared queue and a file lock.

batonq is a single binary with a handful of unix-shaped verbs: `pick`, `done`,
`abandon`, `lock`, `release`. Under the hood it's SQLite and `flock(2)` — no
daemon to configure, no DSL to learn, no workspace to opt into. It composes
with whatever you already use: Claude Code, aider, a bash loop, a cron job,
tmux panes, git worktrees. Point any number of agents at the same queue and
they politely pass the baton: one picks a task, works it, drops it, the next
one picks the next. Files held by a peer are visible; stale locks expire;
everything is inspectable with `cat` and `sqlite3`.

Think of it as the unix-tool cousin of Claude Squad and ccswarm — the part
you'd reach for when you want coordination as a _primitive_, not a platform.
Pass the baton, finish the leg, drop the baton. Small surface, big leverage,
boring on purpose.

## Demo

Run `batonq tui` (or `bun src/tui.tsx` from a checkout) to see the live
dashboard — sessions, tasks, claims, file locks, and recent events in one
ink-rendered view, refreshed every 2s. The layout is described under
[TUI](#tui) below.

> **Screenshot / screencast TBD** — PRs welcome. A real `docs/tui.png` and a
> 3-tab tmux `docs/screencast.gif` (parallel pick → work → done) will land
> alongside v0.2.

## Install

**One-liner (recommended):**

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Salberg87/batonq/main/install.sh | sh
```

The installer checks for `bun` and `jq`, clones the repo, drops the three
binaries into `~/.local/bin/` (or `~/bin/`), merges the Claude Code hooks
into `~/.claude/settings.json` idempotently, and creates the state dirs.
Re-running it is safe — existing hook entries are replaced, not duplicated.

**Manual (if you want to vendor the checkout):**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Salberg87/batonq.git
cd batonq
bun install
export PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH"
```

Or install the three binaries directly to a directory on your `PATH`:

```sh
install -m 0755 src/agent-coord      ~/.local/bin/batonq
install -m 0755 src/agent-coord-hook ~/.local/bin/batonq-hook
install -m 0755 src/agent-coord-loop ~/.local/bin/batonq-loop
```

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) ≥ 1.0, `jq` (for the hooks merge), and
`gtimeout` from GNU coreutils (used by `batonq-loop` to bound each `claude -p`
invocation so a stuck task can't wedge the loop). On macOS:
`brew install coreutils`. On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install -y coreutils`.

> **Heads up on multiple loops per host:** `batonq-loop`'s liveness watchdog
> watches the shared hook log (`~/.claude/batonq-measurement/events.jsonl`).
> If you run two loops on the same machine and only one is making progress,
> the other's watchdog won't fire on its own wedge because the shared log
> keeps getting fresh writes from the peer. Run at most one `batonq-loop` per
> host, or give each loop its own events log.

**Uninstall (if you change your mind):**

```sh
batonq uninstall
# or, without batonq on PATH:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Salberg87/batonq/main/uninstall.sh | sh
```

The uninstaller removes the batonq binaries from `~/.local/bin/` (or `~/bin/`)
and strips the three hook blocks from `~/.claude/settings.json` via `jq`, so
unrelated hooks survive. It then asks whether to delete state
(`~/.claude/batonq-state.db`, `batonq-measurement/`, `batonq-fingerprint.json`).
The default is **no** — data is kept so a later reinstall picks up where you
left off. Pass `--remove-state` (or `-y`) to delete without prompting, or
`--keep-state` to skip the prompt non-interactively.

## Quickstart

**1. Write a task to `~/DEV/TASKS.md`:**

```md
## Pending

- [ ] **any:infra** — add release notes for v0.1.1
```

**2. In the repo you want to work from, start a loop:**

```sh
cd ~/DEV/batonq
batonq-loop
```

The loop spawns a fresh `claude -p` per task, with context cleared between
iterations. Each instance picks, works, and marks done autonomously.

**3. Watch the queue from another tab:**

```sh
batonq tasks     # list everything
batonq tui       # live dashboard
```

That's it. Open another terminal, `cd` into a different repo, and run
`batonq-loop` again — it picks a different task because the first one is
already claimed.

## Concepts

- **Sessions** — each running agent registers a session keyed by pid. Claims
  and locks are owned by a session; a heartbeat keeps them alive. When the
  session dies, `sweep` releases anything it was holding.
- **Tasks** — parsed from `~/DEV/TASKS.md`. Each task gets a stable
  `external_id` derived from repo + body, so editing adjacent lines doesn't
  re-issue IDs. Scope is taken from the bold prefix: `**RepoName**` matches
  only that repo's `cwd`, `**any:tag**` matches any cwd.
- **Verify gates** — add a `verify:` line under a task. On `done`, batonq
  runs the shell command; non-zero exit keeps the task claimed with stderr
  captured, so you never close a task whose own check failed.
- **Judge agent** — an optional second-layer LLM review (`judge:` line).
  Only a `PASS` verdict lets the task close; `FAIL` leaves it claimed with
  the reasoning in the event log.
- **Priority + scheduling** — add optional `priority: high|normal|low`
  (default `normal`) and/or `scheduled_for: <ISO-8601 UTC>` directives
  under a task. `pick` drains `high` before `normal` before `low`; within a
  priority, tasks whose `scheduled_for` is in the future are invisible, and
  ripe tasks fire earliest-first. Stable ordering: `high → normal → low`,
  then `COALESCE(scheduled_for, created_at)` ascending, then `created_at` as
  the final tiebreaker.
- **Hooks** — `batonq-hook` plugs into Claude Code's PreToolUse and
  PostToolUse hooks. Layer 1 appends JSONL measurement events; layer 2
  enforces file locks, so two parallel agents can't write to the same path.

## TUI

`batonq tui` opens a live dashboard backed by the same SQLite state. It
refreshes every 2s and gives you five panels — Sessions, Tasks, Claims, File
locks, Recent events.

**Keybinds:**

| Key            | Action                                                                                                              |

| `Tab`          | Cycle panel focus.                                                                                                  |
| `j` / `↓`      | Move selection down in focused panel.                                                                               |
| `k` / `↑`      | Move selection up in focused panel.                                                                                 |
| `/`            | Filter rows in focused panel. `Esc` cancels.                                                                        |
| `n`            | New task — open an inline form to append one to `TASKS.md` as draft.                                                |
| `e`            | Enrich selected draft via opus. If questions come back, answer inline.                                              |
| `p`            | Promote selected draft to pending so `pick` will see it.                                                            |
| `o`            | Toggle "Original: …" expand/collapse on an enriched draft.                                                          |
| `a`            | Abandon selected task (Tasks panel only).                                                                           |
| `r`            | Release selected lock (Claims panel only).                                                                          |
| `L`            | Restart `batonq-loop` (confirm y/n). Kills running loop + claude-p, re-spawns via `nohup` → `/tmp/batonq-loop.log`. |
| `?`            | Show full help overlay.                                                                                             |

**Loop-status footer:**

Below the four panels the TUI shows a two-line live footer tracking the
`batonq-loop` subsystem, refreshed on the same 2s tick as the panels:

1. **Loop state** — `✅ running` (loop + `claude -p` alive), `⏸ idle` (loop up
   but no claude), or `❌ dead` (no `agent-coord-loop` process). Detected via
   `pgrep -f agent-coord-loop`.
2. **Current task** — the claimed task the loop's PID is working, shown as
   `<external_id[:8]> · <first 50 chars of body>`. Falls back to `— (idle)`
   when nothing is claimed.
3. **Claude-p** — the PID of the oldest-alive `claude -p` process plus its
   elapsed seconds (`ps -o etimes`).
4. **Events age** — seconds since `events.jsonl` was last written. Colour
   flips yellow past **300 s** and red past **600 s** (the watchdog's default
   `BATONQ_WATCHDOG_STALE_SEC`). Missing log → dim `no events.jsonl`.

Press `L` to restart the loop: the TUI opens a confirm prompt, then on `y`
runs `pkill -f agent-coord-loop` and re-spawns `batonq-loop` detached via
`nohup`, logging to `/tmp/batonq-loop.log`. Use this when the events-age cell
has gone red and the queue stopped moving. For scripting, `batonq loop-status
--json` prints the same snapshot from the CLI.

**Add-task form — keybind `n`:**

Opens an overlay with four fields — **Repo** (prefilled from the current cwd's
git-root basename, or `any:infra` when outside a git repo), **Body** (required),
**Verify** (optional shell gate), **Judge** (optional LLM prompt). `Tab` /
`Shift-Tab` moves between fields, `Enter` submits (only when Body is non-empty),
`Esc` cancels without writing. Submitted tasks land under `## Pending` in
`~/DEV/TASKS.md` as **drafts** (`- [?]`), not pending — they're invisible to
`pick` until a human enriches and promotes them.

**Draft workflow — keybinds `e` / `p` / `o`:**

Drafts are the "before an autonomous agent sees it" lane. The TUI marks them
with `📝draft` in the accent colour because the Tasks panel is where you shake
a terse idea into a concrete spec:

1. Press `e` on a selected draft. The TUI spawns `batonq enrich <id>` (calls
   `claude --model opus --dangerously-skip-permissions` under the hood) and
   streams progress to the status line.
2. If opus decides the brief is ambiguous it returns a `QUESTIONS:` block. The
   TUI opens an inline overlay — one input per question, `Tab` navigates,
   `Enter` submits them all. The answers are appended to the draft body and
   `e` is re-run automatically, giving opus another shot with more context.
3. If opus returns a spec, the draft body is rewritten with the elaborated
   text plus `verify:` / `judge:` directives. The Tasks panel then shows a
   **hybrid view**: the enriched spec as the main row, and a collapsed
   `Original: <user-body>` metadata line underneath. Press `o` to expand/
   collapse that line — handy when reviewing opus' interpretation against
   your original phrasing.
4. Press `p` to promote. Status flips `[?]` → `[ ]` in both the DB and
   `TASKS.md`; `pick` will hand it out to the next autonomous agent.

A draft never leaks into `pick` on its own — `selectCandidate` filters on
`status = 'pending'` exactly. Enrichment is the human-in-the-loop step that
keeps opus' default-bias from producing wrong work downstream.

**Task-claim TTL & the `lost` status:**

Claimed tasks carry a 30-minute progress TTL (`TASK_CLAIM_TTL_MS`). Every
PostToolUse hook refreshes `last_progress_at` on the session's claimed tasks,
so an agent actively doing work keeps its claim warm. When `batonq sweep-tasks`
runs — automatically on every `pick`, or on demand — it scans claimed tasks
whose last progress predates the TTL and runs `tryRecoverTaskBeforeMarkLost`
on each. If the claiming session still has a heartbeat within 5 minutes the
task gets a 5-minute grace extension; if the session looks dead, the task
flips to **`lost`** and a JSONL line (timestamp, `external_id`, repo, body
snippet) is appended to `/tmp/batonq-escalations.log` so a human — or another
agent tailing the file — can pick up the pieces. `lost` tasks are out of the
`pick` rotation; abandon + re-promote (or manually flip the DB row back to
`pending`) to re-queue them.

> **TODO:** add `docs/tui.png` once v0.2 ships.

Three moving parts: the **event log** (`events.jsonl`, append-only, grep-able),
the **SQLite state** (`~/.claude/batonq-state.db`, mutated under
transactions), and the **hooks** (`batonq-hook pre|bash|post`, 2-second
timeout, never blocks Claude on its own failure). Everything else is a shell
of unix verbs around those three files.

## FAQ

**Something isn't working — where do I start?**
Run `batonq doctor`. It walks five categories — Binaries, Installation, State,
Scope, Live — and prints `✓ / ⚠ / ✗` per row with a `fix:` hint on every
non-pass. Exit code is 0 when nothing critical is wrong, 1 otherwise. The
output is designed to paste straight into a bug report. Doctor is read-only:
it never edits settings, recreates the DB, or touches your tasks.

**How does this differ from Claude Squad / ccswarm?**
Claude Squad and ccswarm are workspace orchestrators: they own the tmux
layout, the agent lifecycle, and the overall mental model. batonq is the
opposite end of the design space — a single binary wrapping a shared queue
and a file lock, meant to be composed with whatever you already use. If you
want a product, use Squad. If you want a primitive, use batonq.

**What happens if an agent crashes mid-task?**
Nothing stays stuck. Each session has a heartbeat; when it stops, its claims
and file locks go stale. `batonq sweep` (or the TUI running in the
background) reclaims them. The task flips back to `pending` and any other
agent with a matching scope can pick it up.

**Can it coordinate across machines?**
Not yet — state lives in a local SQLite DB (`~/.claude/batonq-state.db`)
and locks use `flock(2)` on the local filesystem. Cross-machine would need
either a hosted DB + lock service or a syncing agent; that's deliberately
out of scope for v0.x. If you mount `~/.claude` over NFS with working byte
locking you get a janky version of it, but I don't recommend it.

**How much overhead does the hook add?**
The PreToolUse hook runs with a 2s timeout and does a single SQLite SELECT
plus one optional INSERT — sub-millisecond in the common case, dominated by
SQLite startup cost (~1–5ms per invocation). The hook fails open: if it
can't reach the DB, the tool call still runs. Measure it yourself on your
own machine with `batonq report --since ...`.

**How do I debug a failing verify gate?**
Three places to look. First, `batonq tail -n 50` — the `verify-failed`
event carries the exit code and captured stderr. Second, `batonq mine` shows
the task still claimed by you with the last error attached. Third, re-run
the gate by hand (`cd <repo> && <the verify command>`) to see full output.
Abandon with `batonq abandon <id>` once you've investigated.

**Where do I find the loop's stdout?**
`batonq-loop` run from the TUI (`L` keybind) detaches via `nohup` and writes
stdout+stderr to `/tmp/batonq-loop.log`. The fastest way to read it alongside
hook events is `batonq logs -f` — it merges the newest `/tmp/batonq-loop*.log`
with `events.jsonl`, paints events cyan and loop lines yellow (errors red),
and polls every 500 ms in follow mode. Filter with `--source loop` to see the
bash script's output only, or `--source events` for hook events only.
